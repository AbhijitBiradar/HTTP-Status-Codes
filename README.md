# HTTP-Status-Codes

1. **What are HTTP status codes?**

    HTTP status codes are three-digit responses from the server to the browser-side request. Everyone has probably gotten the classic 404 page-not-found error. That is an HTTP client error status code and there are a lot more of them.

    These status codes (also called response status codes) serve as a means of communication between the server and the internet browser and there are multiple code classes based on the type of information they are communicating. The differences in classes are indicated through the first digit of the error code, for example: just like a 404, any other 4xx will mean that in some way the page or website could not be reached, while a 2xx means that your request was successfully completed.


2. **How are HTTP status codes categorized?**

    HTTP status codes are split into 5 different categories. Each category will give you hints as to what the response was, even if you don't know the specific response code.

    For an explanation of each category - and each individual status code - click on the corresponding link below or go to our complete list of HTTP status codes.

    1xx - Informational: The server has received the request and is continuing the process 

    2xx - Successful: The request was successful and the browser has received the expected information 

    3xx (Redirection): You have been redirected and the completion of the request requires further action

    4xx (Client Error): The website or the page could not be reached, either the page is unavailable or the request contains bad syntax 

    5xx (Server Error): While the request appears to be valid, the server could not complete the request

3. **1XX Status Codes**

    A 1XX-level status code tells you that the request you’ve made to the server is still in progress for some reason. This isn’t necessarily a problem, it’s just extra information to let you know what’s going on.

    A 1xx Informational status code means that the server has received the request and is continuing the process. A 1xx status code is purely temporary and is given while the request processing continues. For most tasks you won't encounter these much, as it's not the final response to the request.
